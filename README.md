#Linux From Scratch 9.0
This repository contains scripts for each of the install sections of Linux From Scratch version 9.0.
Most of these are for compiling the various packages. Each one unpacks the tarball, compiles and installs, then cleans up. For packages with test suites teh test results are logged back to the directory where the scripts are located.
